## Document Processing Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
1. Split implementation and ingestion:
   - Reason: Keep files under 200 lines
   - Benefit: Clear separation of concerns
   - Learning: Easier to maintain and test
   - Pattern: Delegate document processing to ingestion.ipynb

2. Use Langchain for document handling:
   - Reason: More robust file support
   - Benefit: Better chunking strategies
   - Learning: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter works best
   - Pattern: Map file extensions to specific loaders

3. Preserve chunking config in BaselineRAG:
   - Reason: Keep configuration centralized
   - Benefit: Consistent chunking across system
   - Learning: Pass config to ingestion
   - Pattern: Config flows down, data flows up

### Implementation Patterns
1. Document Processing Flow:
   ```
   BaselineRAG
   -> ingestion.ipynb (with config)
   -> Langchain loaders
   -> Text splitting
   -> Metadata handling
   -> Vector storage
   ```

2. File Organization:
   ```
   implementation.ipynb (core RAG)
   ingestion.ipynb (document processing)
   document_utils.py (utilities)
   ```

3. Memory Bank Structure:
   ```
   codebase.md (implementation details)
   systemPatterns.md (architecture)
   techContext.md (dependencies)
   ```

### Learned Best Practices
1. Document Processing:
   - Always preserve metadata through pipeline
   - Use appropriate loader for each file type
   - Process documents in batches
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. Code Organization:
   - Keep files under 200 lines
   - Document dependencies clearly
   - Use consistent patterns
   - Maintain memory bank

3. Testing Strategy:
   - Test in separate environment from development
   - Create portable test scripts for cross-env testing
   - Verify functionality in both environments
   - Document environment-specific issues
   - Use git for code synchronization between environments
   - Validate document processing
   - Check metadata preservation
   - Validate chunking

### Common Issues
1. Document Processing:
   - Large files need batching
   - Metadata must be preserved
   - Chunking needs configuration
   - File types need proper loaders

2. Implementation:
   - Keep dependencies clear
   - Handle errors properly
   - Maintain documentation
   - Test thoroughly

### Environment Management
1. Development vs. Testing:
   - Development done in primary environment
   - Testing performed in separate environment
   - Use git for code synchronization
   - Create portable test scripts
   - Document environment differences
   - Handle environment-specific configurations

2. Testing Workflow:
   - Create test scripts in tests directory
   - Push changes to repository
   - Pull and run tests in test environment
   - Document test results
   - Update fixes based on test findings

### Future Improvements
1. Document Processing:
   - Add more file types
   - Improve chunking
   - Enhance metadata
   - Add caching

2. Testing:
   - Add unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Measure performance
   - Document patterns
