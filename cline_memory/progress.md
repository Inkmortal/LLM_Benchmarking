# Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### OpenSearch Integration
1. Fixed authentication issues:
   - Implemented proper AWS4Auth
   - Added RequestsHttpConnection
   - Configured SSL settings

2. Improved domain management:
   - Using consistent "rag-bench" domain name
   - Added domain existence check
   - Fixed cleanup handling
   - Added DNS propagation check

3. Removed environment variable dependency:
   - No longer requires OPENSEARCH_HOST
   - Self-manages domain creation/discovery

### Resource Management
1. Improved cleanup handling:
   - Prevent cleanup cascades
   - Added proper deletion waiting
   - Better error handling

2. Added resource discovery:
   - Check for existing domains
   - Reuse resources when possible
   - Proper status checking

## Current Issues

### Neptune Connection
1. Connection failures:
   - Cluster and instance create successfully
   - DNS resolves correctly
   - Connection still fails
   - May be related to async/event loop handling

2. Potential causes:
   - Event loop management
   - Connection pooling
   - IAM auth timing
   - DNS propagation timing

### Next Steps
1. Neptune debugging:
   - Review connection logs
   - Test different connection settings
   - Consider removing async complexity
   - Add more detailed error logging

2. Testing improvements:
   - Add connection validation
   - Improve retry logic
   - Better error reporting

## Known Issues

1. Neptune Connection:
   ```
   Error during initialization: Failed to initialize GraphRAG: Failed to initialize graph store: Failed to connect to Neptune after 10 attempts
   ```
   - Status: Investigating
   - Priority: High
   - Impact: Blocks graph functionality

2. Resource Cleanup:
   - Status: Fixed
   - Previously: Cleanup cascade issues
   - Now: Proper resource isolation

## Future Work

1. Neptune Connection:
   - Simplify connection logic
   - Remove async complexity
   - Add better validation
   - Improve error handling

2. Testing:
   - Add integration tests
   - Improve error reporting
   - Add connection validation
   - Document failure modes

3. Documentation:
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Document connection patterns
   - Add timing considerations
   - Note AWS service quirks
