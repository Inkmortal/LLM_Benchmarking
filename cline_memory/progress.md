# Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### VPC Infrastructure
1. Fixed NAT Gateway issue:
   - Created new NAT Gateway
   - Updated private subnet routes
   - Verified connectivity
   - Cleaned up old NAT Gateway

2. Improved VPC management:
   - Never delete existing VPCs
   - Preserve NAT Gateways
   - Only add missing components
   - Fix invalid configurations

3. Enhanced route handling:
   - Careful route updates
   - Proper validation
   - Connectivity verification
   - Resource preservation

### Neptune Infrastructure
1. Improved resource management:
   - Added configuration validation
   - Implemented fix-first approach
   - Removed automatic cleanup
   - Added cleanup confirmation

2. Enhanced connection handling:
   - Better DNS validation
   - Improved route checking
   - Security group validation
   - Connection testing

3. Testing improvements:
   - CLI script for reliability
   - State persistence fixes
   - Better error handling
   - Recovery procedures

### OpenSearch Integration
1. Fixed authentication issues:
   - Implemented proper AWS4Auth
   - Added RequestsHttpConnection
   - Configured SSL settings

2. Improved domain management:
   - Using consistent "rag-bench" domain name
   - Added domain existence check
   - Fixed cleanup handling
   - Added DNS propagation check

3. Removed environment variable dependency:
   - No longer requires OPENSEARCH_HOST
   - Self-manages domain creation/discovery

## Current Issues

### SageMaker Integration
1. Notebook stability:
   - Kernel restart issues
   - Git repo persistence
   - Connection recovery needed
   - State tracking improvements

2. Testing reliability:
   - CLI script preferred over notebook
   - Need better state persistence
   - Connection recovery patterns
   - Error logging improvements

### Neptune Connection
1. Infrastructure management:
   - Now validates before modifying
   - Fixes configurations when possible
   - Only cleans up as last resort
   - Requires explicit cleanup flag

2. Resource validation:
   - Checks VPC configuration first
   - Validates security groups and routes
   - Verifies DNS and NAT Gateway
   - Tests connectivity end-to-end

## Known Issues

1. SageMaker Notebook:
   ```
   Issue: Notebook instance stability
   Impact: Git repo persistence, kernel restarts
   Status: Use CLI script as workaround
   Priority: Medium
   ```

2. Neptune Testing:
   ```
   Issue: Connection validation
   Impact: Need better state tracking
   Status: Implementing improvements
   Priority: High
   ```

3. VPC Management:
   ```
   Issue: Resource preservation
   Impact: Never delete VPCs or NAT Gateways
   Status: Implemented in code
   Priority: Critical
   ```

## Future Work

1. Infrastructure:
   - Improve validation
   - Add configuration fixes
   - Better cleanup handling
   - State persistence

2. Testing:
   - Enhance CLI script
   - Add connection recovery
   - Improve error logging
   - Better state tracking

3. Documentation:
   - Update testing procedures
   - Document recovery steps
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Note stability concerns

4. VPC Management:
   - Add more validation checks
   - Improve route management
   - Better component tracking
   - Resource state monitoring
