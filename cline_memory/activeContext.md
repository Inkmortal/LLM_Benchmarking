# Active Context

## Current Focus: AWS Service Connectivity

### VPC Management Strategy
1. Resource Preservation
   - Never delete existing VPCs
   - Preserve NAT Gateways
   - Only add missing components
   - Fix invalid configurations

2. NAT Gateway Handling
   - Validate existing NAT Gateway first
   - Create in public subnet if needed
   - Update private subnet routes
   - Verify connectivity after changes

3. Route Table Management
   - Check existing routes
   - Update carefully
   - Validate after changes
   - Ensure proper internet access

### Neptune Connection Strategy
1. Infrastructure Management
   - Always validate before modifying
   - Fix configurations when possible
   - Only cleanup as last resort
   - Require explicit cleanup flag

2. Resource Validation
   - Check VPC configuration first
   - Validate security groups and routes
   - Verify DNS and NAT Gateway
   - Test connectivity end-to-end

3. SageMaker Integration
   - Notebook instance stability issues
   - Git repo persistence concerns
   - Kernel restart handling
   - Connection recovery patterns

### Connection Issues
1. Current Status
   - Infrastructure validation improved
   - Fix-first approach implemented
   - Cleanup requires confirmation
   - Better error reporting

2. Potential Issues
   - Notebook instance stability
   - Git repo persistence
   - Kernel connection handling
   - Resource state tracking

3. Next Steps
   - Use CLI script over notebook
   - Improve state persistence
   - Add connection recovery
   - Better error logging
