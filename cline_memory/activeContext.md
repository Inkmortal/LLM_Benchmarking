# Active Context

## Current Focus: AWS Service Connectivity

### OpenSearch Connection Issues
1. Domain Name Management
   - Keep domain names short and consistent
   - Use fixed names for benchmarking (e.g., "rag-bench")
   - Check for existing domains before creating new ones

2. Authentication
   - Must use AWS4Auth with proper credentials
   - Requires RequestsHttpConnection class
   - Need proper SSL settings

3. DNS Resolution
   - Wait for DNS propagation after domain creation
   - Check DNS resolution explicitly
   - Handle connection retries properly

### Neptune Connection Issues
1. Current Status
   - Still experiencing connection issues
   - Cluster and instance are created successfully
   - Connection fails even with proper setup

2. Potential Issues
   - DNS propagation timing
   - Event loop/async handling
   - Connection pooling settings
   - IAM auth configuration

3. Next Steps to Investigate
   - Review Neptune connection logs
   - Check IAM permissions
   - Test with different connection settings
   - Consider synchronous alternatives

## Recent Changes

### OpenSearch Integration
1. Simplified domain management:
   - Using consistent "rag-bench" domain name
   - Added domain existence check
   - Proper cleanup handling

2. Improved auth handling:
   - Added AWS4Auth setup
   - Using RequestsHttpConnection
   - Proper SSL configuration

### Neptune Integration
1. Current challenges:
   - Connection failures after successful creation
   - Need to investigate timing/async issues
   - May need to simplify connection logic

## Active Decisions

1. Domain Naming
   - Use consistent, short names
   - Avoid dynamic/hashed names
   - Reuse domains when possible

2. Resource Management
   - Check for existing resources first
   - Handle cleanup carefully
   - Prevent cleanup cascades

3. Connection Strategy
   - Handle DNS propagation explicitly
   - Use proper auth mechanisms
   - Implement robust retry logic

## Next Steps

1. Neptune Connection
   - Debug connection failures
   - Review async implementation
   - Consider simpler connection pattern

2. Testing
   - Add connection validation
   - Improve error handling
   - Add detailed logging

3. Documentation
   - Document connection patterns
   - Note timing considerations
   - Record troubleshooting steps
