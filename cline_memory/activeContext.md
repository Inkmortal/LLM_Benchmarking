# Active Development Context

## Current Implementation Focus
Testing and benchmarking baseline RAG implementation with Covid-19 dataset while preparing for GraphRAG development.

## Recent Progress
### Baseline RAG Implementation ✅
- Core RAG System:
  - Implemented BaselineRAG class with complete pipeline
  - Integrated Cohere embeddings (1024 dimensions)
  - Set up Claude 3.5 Sonnet for responses
  - Configured OpenSearch with KNN vector search
- Key Features:
  - Batched document ingestion with metadata
  - Cosine similarity search with top-k retrieval
  - Context-aware response generation
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Rate limiting and resource management

### Evaluation Framework ✅
- Metrics System:
  - Implemented RAGMetricsEvaluator with async support
  - Integrated full RAGAs metric suite:
    - Faithfulness scoring
    - Context precision/recall
    - Response relevancy
    - Entity tracking
    - Noise sensitivity
  - Added support for both labeled/unlabeled evaluation
  - Implemented batching (20 calls/batch) with rate limiting

- Benchmarking Pipeline:
  - Created baseline_rag_benchmark.ipynb
  - Automated dataset loading and preparation
  - Implemented comprehensive evaluation flow
  - Added result saving and visualization
  - Set up performance monitoring

## Active Tasks
1. Baseline RAG Testing:
   - Running full benchmark suite on Covid-19 dataset
   - Analyzing metric scores and patterns
   - Identifying performance bottlenecks
   - Testing example queries for qualitative assessment
   - Documenting benchmark results

2. GraphRAG Development Planning:
   - Designing Neptune database schema
   - Planning entity extraction pipeline
   - Architecting hybrid search system
   - Defining graph traversal patterns
   - Preparing integration tests

## Recent Decisions
1. Dataset Selection:
   - Using Origin of Covid-19 dataset for initial testing
   - Implementing automatic dataset downloading
   - Setting up document caching system

2. Implementation Strategy:
   - Keeping implementations dataset-agnostic
   - Git-ignoring vector stores and datasets
   - Using local development with SageMaker deployment option

## Known Issues & Considerations
- Rate limiting needed for batch operations
- Vector store size management required
- Cache invalidation strategy needed
- Performance optimization opportunities identified

## Next Actions
1. Complete Covid-19 dataset benchmarking
2. Begin Neptune setup for GraphRAG
3. Design hybrid search architecture
4. Document initial findings

## Development Notes
- All implementations maintain dataset agnosticism
- setup.ipynb handles environment configuration
- Local development workflow established:
  1. Local code development and testing
  2. SageMaker notebook deployment
  3. Environment configuration
  4. Benchmark execution
