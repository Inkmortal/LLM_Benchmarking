# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Refactoring graph RAG implementation for better maintainability
- Breaking down large components into smaller, focused modules
- Improving evaluation metrics and visualization

## Recent Changes
1. Created dedicated components directory for graph RAG:
   - document_processor.py: Document loading and preprocessing
   - graph_store.py: Neptune graph database operations
   - vector_store.py: OpenSearch vector operations
   - hybrid_search.py: Combined graph and vector search
   - response_generator.py: LLM response generation
   - metrics.py: Graph-specific metrics and visualization

2. Improved graph metrics:
   - Added graph coverage calculation
   - Added graph relevance metrics
   - Enhanced visualization capabilities
   - Kept metrics with implementation rather than in utils

3. Streamlined benchmark notebook:
   - Follows same structure as baseline benchmark
   - Uses modular components
   - Cleaner evaluation flow
   - Better organized results saving

## Active Decisions
1. Keep graph-specific code within graph RAG components to:
   - Avoid affecting baseline implementation
   - Make it easier to maintain
   - Allow for independent evolution

2. Follow consistent patterns:
   - Same notebook structure as baseline
   - Similar configuration approach
   - Shared evaluation framework

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more graph metrics:
   - Path-based relevance
   - Entity importance weighting
   - Relation confidence scoring

2. Potential improvements:
   - Add graph visualization tools
   - Enhance entity extraction
   - Optimize graph query performance
