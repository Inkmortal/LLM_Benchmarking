# Active Context

## Current Focus
Testing and optimizing baseline RAG implementation with Covid-19 dataset while preparing for GraphRAG development.

## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions (2024-02-13)
1. **Vector Store Selection**
   - Chose Amazon OpenSearch for vector storage
   - Reasons:
     - Native AWS integration
     - Efficient vector search
     - Scalable architecture
     - Cost-effective for our use case

2. **LLM Selection**
   - Selected Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Bedrock
   - Reasons:
     - Strong performance characteristics
     - Cost-effective for testing
     - Good context handling
     - Native AWS integration

3. **Embedding Model**
   - Chose Cohere Embed English via Bedrock
   - Reasons:
     - High-quality embeddings
     - 1024 dimensions suitable for our needs
     - Cost-effective for testing
     - Native AWS integration
