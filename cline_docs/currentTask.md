# Current Task: RAG Implementation and Benchmarking

## Completed Setup
- Created project directory structure
- Set up essential documentation
- Implemented core utilities:
  - Notebook import functionality
  - Generic metrics evaluation
  - Flexible visualization tools
- Created evaluation templates:
  - RAG comparison pipeline
  - RAG tuning pipeline

## Current Implementation
### Core Components âœ…
- RAG Metrics:
  - RAGAs integration for evaluation
  - Support for labeled and unlabeled datasets
  - Implementation comparison capabilities
  - Async support with rate limiting
- Visualization:
  - Multiple plot types (bar, radar, heatmap, etc.)
  - Flexible data input handling
  - Report generation
  - Time series support

### Baseline RAG
- Implementation complete with:
  - Cohere Embed English for embeddings
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet for LLM responses
  - Amazon OpenSearch for vector storage
- Features:
  - Generic document ingestion
  - Vector similarity search
  - Context-aware response generation
  - Batch processing support

### Benchmarking
- Using Origin of Covid-19 dataset from LlamaIndex
- Features:
  - Automatic dataset downloading
  - Document ingestion with caching
  - RAG evaluation using RAGAs metrics
  - Performance visualization

## Next Steps
1. Test baseline RAG with Covid-19 dataset:
   - Run benchmarking notebook
   - Analyze performance metrics
   - Identify areas for improvement

2. Implement GraphRAG:
   - Set up Neptune for graph database
   - Integrate with OpenSearch for hybrid search
   - Create graph-based ingestion pipeline
   - Implement query interface

3. Compare implementations:
   - Run benchmarks on both implementations
   - Analyze performance differences
   - Document findings and insights

## Notes
- All implementations are dataset-agnostic
- Vector stores and datasets are git-ignored
- setup.ipynb handles:
  - Environment setup
  - AWS credentials verification
  - Required package installation
  - Directory creation
- Local development with SageMaker deployment:
  1. Develop and test code locally
  2. Clone to SageMaker notebook
  3. Run setup.ipynb to configure environment
  4. Execute benchmarking notebooks
