# Current Task: RAG Implementation Development

## Completed Setup
- Created project directory structure
- Set up essential documentation
- Implemented core utilities:
  - Notebook import functionality
  - Generic metrics evaluation
  - Flexible visualization tools
- Created evaluation templates:
  - RAG comparison pipeline
  - RAG tuning pipeline

## Current Objectives
- Implement baseline RAG and GraphRAG
- Set up AWS service integration
- Create data ingestion pipelines

## Context
- Framework is ready for RAG implementations
- Using AWS services (Bedrock, OpenSearch, Neptune)
- Need both labeled and unlabeled evaluation support

## Next Steps
1. Implement baseline RAG:
   - Set up OpenSearch for vector storage
   - Integrate with Bedrock for embeddings
   - Create ingestion pipeline
   - Implement query interface

2. Implement GraphRAG:
   - Set up Neptune for graph database
   - Integrate with OpenSearch for hybrid search
   - Create graph-based ingestion pipeline
   - Implement query interface

3. Test implementations:
   - Verify AWS service integration
   - Test with sample datasets
   - Validate evaluation pipeline

## Related Tasks from Roadmap
- Phase 2: RAG Implementations
  - Implement baseline RAG with ingestion
  - Implement GraphRAG with ingestion
  - Create standardized interfaces
