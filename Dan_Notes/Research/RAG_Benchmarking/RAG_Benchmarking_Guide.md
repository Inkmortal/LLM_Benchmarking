# Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Labeled and Unlabeled Datasets

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance language model responses by integrating external information retrieval, making them powerful tools for question-answering and enterprise applications. However, evaluating their effectiveness is complex due to the interplay between retrieval quality and response generation. This guide provides a detailed approach for data scientists to evaluate RAG models using both labeled and unlabeled datasets and tools like RAGAs.

## Why Evaluate RAG Systems?

Evaluating RAG systems ensures:
- **Accurate Information Retrieval**: The retrieved documents should contain relevant data.
- **Faithful Response Generation**: The response must be factually grounded in retrieved documents.
- **Overall Relevance**: The generated answer should adequately address the query.

Using labeled datasets helps standardize evaluation and minimize subjective AI grading errors, while unlabeled datasets provide real-world performance assessment.

## Key Evaluation Metrics

### Retrieval Metrics
- **Context Precision**: Measures how many retrieved contexts are relevant to the query.
- **Context Recall**: Assesses whether all necessary information was retrieved.
- **Context Relevance**: Determines if the retrieved documents align with the query intent.

### Generation Metrics
- **Faithfulness**: Measures whether the generated response is based on retrieved contexts.
- **Answer Relevance**: Evaluates the response's pertinence to the query.
- **Semantic Similarity**: Compares the generated response with a human-annotated reference answer.
- **Answer Correctness**: Assesses whether the generated response is factually correct.

## Implementing a RAG Evaluation Pipeline

### Steps to Evaluate RAG Performance

1. **Load a Labeled Dataset**: Use publicly available datasets (e.g., LlamaIndex) containing query-response pairs and retrieved contexts.
2. **Run the RAG Pipeline**: Generate responses using your RAG model.
3. **Compare Results Against Labeled Data**: Use AI-based metrics to measure accuracy and relevance.
4. **Analyze Performance Metrics**: Aggregate scores and identify improvement areas.
5. **Evaluate Unlabeled Data**: Apply unsupervised methods (e.g., clustering, confidence scoring) to analyze real-world effectiveness.
6. **Integrate Human-in-the-loop Evaluation**: Supplement automated scoring with human feedback to ensure accuracy and fairness.

### Using RAGAs for Automated Evaluation

[RAGAs](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) is a Python library designed to automate RAG evaluation. It calculates retrieval and generation scores using a combination of AI-assisted and reference-based techniques.

#### RAGAs with Labeled Datasets

RAGAs works well with labeled datasets by comparing generated answers against human-verified responses. It computes similarity metrics and faithfulness based on retrieved contexts.

#### RAGAs with Unlabeled Datasets

For unlabeled datasets, RAGAs can still provide insights using model-based scoring techniques. Some approaches include:
- **LLM-based Self-Evaluation**: Checking faithfulness and consistency of answers.
- **Confidence Scores**: Using AI models to determine response reliability.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Identifying trends in retrieved content and generated outputs.

#### Evaluating Using a Non-LLM Metric

RAGAs also supports non-LLM-based metrics, ensuring a more interpretable and deterministic evaluation process. These include:
- **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between retrieved documents and the generated response.
- **BM25-based Retrieval Scoring**: Evaluates the ranking effectiveness of retrieved documents.
- **Exact Match Accuracy**: Compares generated answers to reference answers using token-level matching.

#### Example Pipeline Using RAGAs

```python
from ragas import evaluate
from ragas.metrics import faithfulness, context_precision, answer_relevance

def evaluate_rag(dataset, rag_pipeline, labeled=True):
    results = []
    
    for entry in dataset:
        query = entry['query']
        retrieved_contexts, generated_answer = rag_pipeline(query)
        
        if labeled:
            reference_answer = entry['reference_answer']
            scores = evaluate(
                query, generated_answer, retrieved_contexts,
                metrics=[faithfulness, context_precision, answer_relevance]
            )
        else:
            scores = evaluate(
                query, generated_answer, retrieved_contexts,
                metrics=[faithfulness, context_precision]
            )
        
        results.append(scores)
    
    return results
```

## Interpreting the Results

- **High context precision but low faithfulness?** The model retrieves the right documents but doesnâ€™t generate accurate responses.
- **Low context recall?** The retriever needs improvement in fetching relevant documents.
- **Low semantic similarity?** The generated answer diverges from human-verified responses, indicating hallucinations.
- **Confidence score variability in unlabeled datasets?** Model performance is inconsistent and requires further refinement.
- **Discrepancies between LLM and non-LLM evaluations?** Indicates a need for cross-verification with deterministic scoring methods.

## Additional Considerations

### Handling Bias in RAG Evaluation

Automated evaluations, particularly those using LLMs, may introduce bias into the evaluation process. Strategies to mitigate this include:
- Using **multi-metric scoring** that combines LLM and non-LLM approaches.
- Leveraging **human-in-the-loop validation** for critical use cases.
- Establishing a **gold-standard dataset** with diverse and well-validated reference answers.

### Performance Benchmarks and Model Comparisons

For a well-rounded evaluation, data scientists should:
- Compare RAG model outputs against **baseline retrieval models** (e.g., traditional keyword-based retrieval).
- Use **A/B testing** to measure improvements across multiple RAG versions.
- Monitor **scalability and latency** when integrating retrieval-based augmentation in production settings.

## Conclusion

Evaluating RAG models is essential for improving performance and ensuring accuracy. Using structured labeled datasets and automated tools like RAGAs, data scientists can benchmark retrieval and generation components effectively. For unlabeled datasets, unsupervised evaluation methods such as confidence scoring and self-evaluation provide insights into real-world performance. Future iterations should incorporate both AI-based and human-in-the-loop evaluation for optimal results.
